        <h1>Cell Type Annotation Robot (Cellar)</h1>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
        Single-cell transcriptomics coupled with recent technological developments in high-throughput sequencing technologies have greatly expanded our knowledge of complex tissues and their cellular composition. As the number of samples increases, there is a growing need to correctly and automatically identify cell types by examining the gene expression profiles of individual cells. Cellar is an attempt to combine different methods and processing pipelines into a easy-to-use interface that allows the user to interact with the data and facilitate the process of cell type annotation.
        <br><br>Cellar is hosted at <a href="https://data.test.hubmapconsortium.org/app/cellar" class="mylink">https://data.test.hubmapconsortium.org/app/cellar</a>.
